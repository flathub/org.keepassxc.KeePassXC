Subject: [PATCH 2/5] Support reverse-dns filenames for data files

Flatpak isolates application files from the host, but some files must be
exported to the host to serve their purpose (ex. desktop entries, icons
mime types, etc...). Filenames must however be prefixed by the app id, in
reverse-dns notation (org.keepassxc.KeePassXC).

If KEEPASSXC_DIST_TYPE=Flatpak is set CMake can now install files with
exportable filenames, without affecting other distribution types.
