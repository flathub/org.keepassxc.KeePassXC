Subject: [PATCH 4/5] Use RuntimeDirectory for opening attachments

There is a minor lack of consistency when as to where temporary files,
sockets etc should be located. Sometimes there are good reasons, but
not always.

With this change attachments can be opened by other applications without
the need to share all of /tmp with other applications. It only applies
to Flatpak for now, but can easily be adjusted to apply everywhere.

This change does not affect the main keepassxc lock file and the related
socket. That cannot change without upstream, since all packages need to
use the same path. Because of this, /tmp still cannot be sandboxed.
